-- Factory Farming Tech Demo --
You're free to look around this example factory.
You will find facilities up to Tech Tier 3.
The full game goes up to Tech Tier 7.
Building and Saving are disabled in the demo.
-- The Initial Seed Purchase --
Welcome to Factory Farming! There's money to be
made, and it won't make itself! So let's get started by
visiting the shop with Ⓐ and buying some carrot seeds
The compass (right) will always point to the shop.
Move with the D-Pad, ✛. Zoom in & out with 🎣.
Hold Ⓑ to run.  Go to the shop and press Ⓐ.
Buy 10 carrot seeds from the shop with Ⓐ.
Press Ⓑ to exit the shop.
-- The Next Objective --
Your current objective is to sell at least
10 carrots. You can check what your current objective
is at any time by pressing the Menu button.
Do this now.
Press the Menu button to see your current objective.
From here you can also save and load the game, and
open the main menu with game settings etc.
     
-- The First Crops --
Good, carrots will grow well in the silty soil near to the
shop. Pay attention to the soil & water each plant likes.
Find a good nearby spot, open your inventory
with Ⓐ, select the seeds, and plant 10 carrots.
Find a nearby area of silty soil, preferably moist.
Press Ⓐ to enter your inventory, select the carrot
seeds and press Ⓐ again. Plant 10 carrot seeds on
empty patches of silty soil, then press Ⓑ.
-- The First Harvest --
Great, crops normally take some time to yield produce,
but let's speed up these carrot plants. Press Ⓐ, choose
Pickup Cargo Mode' and harvest 10 grown carrots.
You can pickup any cargo in the world, or in buildings.
Go to where you planted your carrot seeds.
Press Ⓐ to enter your inventory, select 'Pickup
Cargo Mode'. Press or hold Ⓐ when moving, pickup 10
grown carrots. Use the 🎣 to change the pickup area.
-- The First Sale --
Nice, you know what we can do with cargo like those
fresh carrots? Sell them for a profit! Visit the sales
depot (next to the shop) and press Ⓐ to access the
sales menu. Sell 10 carrots to continue.
Go to the sales depot (next to the shop).
Press or hold Ⓐ to sell at least 10 carrots.
Change the amount sold with each press of Ⓐ by
turning the 🎣, or hold Ⓑ and press ⬆️ or ⬇️.
-- The First Automated Harvest --
Sweet, but that was a lot of manual labor... Let's
use an automatic harvester instead! Buy one from
the shop and build it where some carrot plants are
within its harvest catchment area.
Go to the the shop, buy an automatic harvester.
Press Ⓐ and choose this from your inventory.
Place the harvester such that it located on empty
soil, and carrot plants are within its harvest range.
-- The First Cargo Line --
Good, We're harvesting carrots. But we need to get them
to the sales depot. We need conveyor belts! Buy around
50 from the shop and lay the path to move & sell
the carrots. Rotate belt pieces with 🎣 or Ⓑ + ✛.
Go to the the shop, buy around 50 conveyor belts.
Press Ⓐ and choose these from your inventory.
Make a chain of belts from the automatic harvester to
sales. Rotate belts with 🎣, or hold Ⓑ and press ✛.
-- Mining The Earth --
OK. But not all exploitable resources are grown.
Some are dug up, or pumped out. Let's build a chalk
quarry next. Buy one from the shop and build it on
chalky soil. There should be some to the north.
Go to the the shop, buy a chalk quarry.
Press Ⓐ and choose this from your inventory.
Go north from the shop and look for chalky soil.
Place the quarry on at least one chalky soil tile.
-- Manufacturing Value --
Nice. We can finally set up a full production line!
Buy a vitamin factory from the shop, supply it with
both chalk and carrots, and transport the vitamins
to the sales depot for a much bigger profit!
Go to the the shop, buy a vitamin factory.
Place it in a good spot. Use conveyor belts to
supply it with carrots and chalk. Use a more belts
to transport the vitamins to the sales depot.
-- Go Forth And Consume --
Excellent! You now know all the basics of exploiting
the world for profit. As your bank account swells,
more crops, factories, and other items will unlock.
Use them to maximize profit, maximize efficiency.
-- But I Don't Have The Soil For That! --
Problem. The cactus plant you just unlocked wants
sandy soil, but there isn't any here. Expansion time!
Visit the plots depot (next to sales) and buy a new
plot of land to develop.
The plots depot, exports depot and
imports depot are all now unlocked.
Visit the plots depot to the right of sales.
Buy a new plot of land to expand the factory.
-- A New Horizon --
Welcome to you new plot of land! More room for your
manufacturing empire to grow. Instead of selling cargo,
you can also move it between plots. Use belts to feed
cargo in to the exports depot in any of your plots.
Export some cargo by moving it via belts into the
exports depot (to the right of the plot depot) on
any plot. The export rate of each cargo type is
averaged over the previous two minutes.
-- Accessing The Goods --
Now that you're exporting cargo, let's look at imports too.
Go to a different plot and visit the imports depot,
you can import up to four cargo per plot.
Try setting up an import now.
Import some cargo in a different plot via the imports
depot (right of the exports depot). N, S, E, W
imports can be individually chosen. You cannot export a
cargo type which is being imported to the same plot.
-- Imports & Exports & Plots --
Wonderful! Continue to buy more plots in order to
access new soil types and to expand the factory.
Use the export and import depots to move cargo
between plots, and continue to maximize efficiency!
